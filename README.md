# PotterCrash #ColorBuster
Potter Crash is the name given to the game that was developed. This is a fun game in which an interface is provided for the user to select 
and destroy blocks that have the same color and are adjacent to each other in order to get points. As the user scores points the system will
keep track of it and it will display it for the user to see.

Future Implementations
In the future, the game shall store the names and highest scores associated with it. A database can be implemented later on, in order to 
display a top ten highest scores of all people who have played the game and the ability to add music to the game while the user is playing. 
Better adjustments can be done to the UI and the implementation of special tiles can be added later on.
